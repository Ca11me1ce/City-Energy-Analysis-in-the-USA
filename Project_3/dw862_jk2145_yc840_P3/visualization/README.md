# README

This part is used to combine three datasets and generate the overall labels for each state.

## visualizaion.py
This is a python script file. It changes the lable from int to str which used for plot, calculates the averge energy usage for each attribute in every state(used for d3 plot) and changes the dataframe structure and use new dataframe to draw plotly plot.

## final_residential.csv; final_commercial.csv; final_industrial.csv; class_state.csv
These datasets are input datasets.

## Plotly folder
It includes six pictures which generated by visualization.py

## Tableau folder
It includes a readme.md which includes some public website links and plot description.

##  d3 folder
This folder includes six plots which implemented by d3. They represents the average energy usage in each state(commercial electricity, commercial natural gas, industrial electricity, industrial natuarl gas, residential electricity and residentail nartual gas.

## final_class_residential.csv; final_class_commercial.csv; final_class_industrial.csv; final_class_state.csv
These datasets are the same format dataset after transformation.

## box_commercial_elec.csv; box_commercial_gas.csv; box_industrial_elec.csv; box_industrial_gas.csv; box_residential_elec.csv; box_residential_gas.csv
These datasets are generated by visualization.py and they are used to generate the plots by plotly.

## state_residential.csv; state_residential1.csv; state_residential2.csv 
These datasets are generated by visualizaion.py which calculated residential average energy usage and used by d3.

# state_commercial.csv; state_commercial1.csv; state_commercial2.csv
These datasets are generated by visualizaion.py which calculated commercial average energy usage and used by d3.

# state_industrial.csv; state_industrial1.csv; state_industrial2.csv
These datasets are generated by visualizaion.py which calculated industrial average energy usage and used by d3.
